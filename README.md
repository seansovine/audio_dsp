# Audio Digital Signal Processing

This project will have examples and information gathered about
digital signal processing for audio. 

The first plan is to implement a basic graphic equalizer using 
an IIR filter. For this we will probably use an existing library
to load in the audio data from a WAV file. We will start simple,
and then build up from there.

We're planning to use the Q library ([GitHub](https://github.com/seansovine/audio_dsp))
of Joel de Guzman, author of several great Boost libraries,
among other things. (You are one of my heroes, Joel!)
